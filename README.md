# jQuery's most marvelous Table Enhancer Plugin

## Why yet an other?

This is actually only a showcase of the basic structure of my Javascript code.
In the end, it will be fully documented and will allow me to have a good reference for people to see some code!

## Functionalities

The plugin is build to simply bootstrap itself on a empty `<table></table>`. To fill the table,
you simply need to pass in an aray of formated objects, i.e. each label will become a column header
(snake_eyed will be turn into Snake Eyed), and it's value will.. stay a value.

Miscellanous other feature :

- Allow in place deletion and addition
- and the ability to provide your own callback so it fits your mode
- Alow for complex data (for example one contact, hence one row, wich can have multiple phone numbers (in one cell)) to be displayed
- Configurable (and more to come!)

Thank you. Enjoy
