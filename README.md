TableEnhancerPlugin
===================

This is a small jQuery plugin to help create enhanced table.

** Why yet an other?

This is actually only a showcase of the basic structure of my Javascript code.
In the end, it will be fully documented and will allow me to have a good reference for people to see some code!

** Functionalities

The plugin is build to simply bootstrap itself on a empty `<table></table>`. To fill the table,
you simply need to pass in an aray of formated objects, i.e. each label will become a column header
(snake_eyed will be turn into Snake Eyed), and it's value will.. stay a value.

Miscellanous other feature :

- Allow in place delete or add of any row
- Alow for complex data (for example one contact, hence one row, wich can have multiple phone numbers) to be displayed (in a weirrd way? aha)
- Configurable (and more to come!)

Thank you and good night.
